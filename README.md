## Purpose
This porfolio was created to practice my knowledge of HTML and CSS. It will be updated later as I learn new things to showcase my skills and projects. 

## Functionality
This site is responsive across multiple device widths such as smart phones, tablets and desktops. Color pallet consists of navy, purple and pink to create a professional, fun and futuristic appearance. There are 4 pages:  
1. Index/Home: is a landing page and contains a photo and information of the creator (me) such as skills, experience and a link to a Resume on Google Drive.  
2. Projects: contains of 4 madeup projects, arranged using Grid in CSS. Each project "card" provided information about the project such as category, name, and a blurb.  
3. Blogs: shows 5 blog "cards" styled as boxes. They were arranged using Grid in CSS. Each card had information about the blog such as category, title, author and date published.
4. Get in touch: has linked to my social accounts (GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter)

My favourite feature of the page is the use of Grid, it allows each "card" to be responsive to changes in the viewports without too much overridding.
